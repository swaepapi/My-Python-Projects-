# My Python Projects

Welcome to my Python projects repository! This is where I'll be documenting my journey in learning Python through building various small projects. Each project will demonstrate different aspects of Python, from basic scripting to more complex applications, as I gradually improve my skills.

## Repository Structure

- `/Expense Calculator`: This folder contains the code for the **Expense Calculator** project, which helps users track expenses by category, view, and calculate totals.
- `/Number Guessing Game`: This folder contains the **Number Guessing Game** project, where users try to guess a randomly generated number.
- `/To Do App`: This folder contains the **To Do List App**, which allows users to create, view, and manage a list of tasks.
- `/LICENSE`: The license file for the repository.
- `/README.md`: The README file, providing an overview and instructions for the repository.

Additional projects will be added here as I continue learning.


## Project 1: To-Do App

### Overview

The To-Do app allows users to manage their daily tasks by adding, viewing, marking as done, and removing tasks. This project will help me practice:
- Input and output handling
- Loops and conditional logic
- Lists and basic data structures
- File I/O (to save tasks for future use)

### Features

1. **Add a task**: Allows the user to add new tasks to the to-do list.
2. **View tasks**: Displays all the current tasks.
3. **Mark task as complete**: Updates the status of a task as done.
4. **Remove a task**: Allows the user to delete a task from the list.
5. **Save tasks**: Tasks are stored in a file to persist data even after the program closes.

### Future Improvements

- Add a simple GUI using a library like Tkinter or PyQt.
- Implement categories for tasks.
- Set deadlines and reminders for tasks.

## Approach to Tackling Projects

For each project I build, I will follow this approach:

### 1. **Concept Understanding**

   - Before starting any project, I will thoroughly research and understand the concept.
   - I will document key learnings and concepts related to the project in the README.

### 2. **Project Planning**

   - I will break down the project into small, manageable tasks using pseudocode or flowcharts.
   - Identify the Python concepts and libraries I need to learn for each task.

### 3. **Development**

   - I will begin by building a simple, functional version of the project.
   - Each step will be versioned in the repository with detailed commit messages.
   - I will start with a command-line interface and later expand into GUI or web-based versions if applicable.

### 4. **Testing**

   - I will test my projects thoroughly for edge cases.
   - Automated testing will be implemented as I grow more comfortable with tools like `unittest` or `pytest`.

### 5. **Documentation**

   - I will include clear and concise documentation for each project:
     - **README.md**: Project overview, setup instructions, and usage.
     - **Comments**: In-line comments within the code to explain logic.

### 6. **Reflection**

   - After completing each project, I will reflect on what I learned, any challenges faced, and how I solved them.
   - Each projectâ€™s README will have a "Lessons Learned" section to document these reflections.
